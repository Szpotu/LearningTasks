Jeremy Clarkson has been driving cars, writing about them and occasionally voicing his opinions on the BBC's Top Gear for twenty years. No one in the business is taller.

As coal mines closed and house prices exploded to a soundtrack of men in make-up playing synthesizers, Jeremy was already waxing lyrical on topics as useful and diverse as: • The perils of bicycle ownership • Why Australians - not Brits - need bull bars • Why soon only geriatrics will be driving BMWs • The difficultly of deciding on the best car for your wedding • Why Jesus's dad would have owned a Nissan Bluebird • And why it is that bus lanes cause traffic jams Irreverent, damn funny and offensive to almost everyone, this is writing with its foot to the floor, the brake lines cut and the speed limit smashed to smithereens.

HOWEVER, ONE THING WAS CLEAR; HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE AWAY FROM OUR SCREENS FOR LONG... During his time on Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson established himself as the nation's favourite motoring aficionado but also an unlikely political commentator with a knack for telling it like it is (and putting his foot in it). However, his 'gaffes' only made the nation love him more. Whilst the Beeb tried to revive Top Gear after the departure of Clarkson, May and Hammond with an all-star line-up including Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, something just wasn't right. They soon learned to their cost that there's no one quite like Clarkson. From scandals over 'feckless Mexicans' and infamous punch-ups to his escapades on The Grand Tour, this is the true story of his extraordinary life and career. This entertaining and fully up-to-date biography charts Clarkson's rise and fall (and rise again) along with the uncensored views and hilarious anecdotes that have made him a national treasure.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781786065445"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1786065444"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":300,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.gr/books?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=clarcson&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GR","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-vTmtDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GR","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.gr/books/download/Clarkson_Look_Who_s_Back-sample-epub.acsm?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.gr/books/download/Clarkson_Look_Who_s_Back-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vTmtDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"They soon learned to their cost that there&#39;s no one quite like Clarkson.

Jeremy Clarkson has seen rather more of the world than most. He has, as they say, been around a bit. And as a result, he's got one or two things to tell us about how it all works - and being Jeremy Clarkson he's not about to voice them quietly, humbly and without great dollops of humour. In The World According to Clarkson, he reveals why it is that: • Too much science is bad for our health • '70s rock music is nothing to be ashamed of • Hunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor clever • We must work harder to get rid of cricket • He liked the Germans (well, sometimes) With a strong dose of common sense that is rarely, if ever, found inside the M25, Clarkson hilariously attacks the pompous, the ridiculous, the absurd and the downright idiotic, whilst also celebrating the eccentric, the clever and the sheer bloody brilliant. Less a manifesto for living and more a road map to modern life, The World According to Clarkson is the funniest book you'll read this year. Don't leave home without it.
